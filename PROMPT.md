In this assessment, you will be submitting your solution using git. To do so, you will need to clone the repo linked above, and push all your changes to the dev branch (which is also the default branch). You will be submitting this assessment by creating a pull request between the dev and the main branch.

If you need help with how to clone the repo to work on the project locally, see this link for help.

## Overview
In this project, you will build a front-end application using the Lord of the Rings API.

### Goal
Build a React application that consumes the API from The Lord of the Rings and displays the information in your website. We want to only display the movies, characters, and quotes models. You can ignore the other models. Feel free to use any additional library you want as long as you use React and Typescript.

### Please pay attention to the following:

- Code quality and readability.
- Good UI/UX is important at LibLab. Users will be using this for web and mobile.
- Modify the README file in the repo, specifying how to install, use and test the website.
- The website does not have to mirror the API. You can add abstractions and/or combine different calls. However, the website should make accessible all of the information provided by the API for the movies, characters, and quotes models
- The website has to be able to run locally.
- The website has to have a live demo - specifically, a deployed version of your app, not just a video demonstration.
- Modify the design.md with information about your design.
- Time requirement: candidates usually spend between 2-5 hours on this task on average; please spend as much time as you feel is necessary to complete the task. We ask that you submit the project code within 48 hours.

Once you have finished writing your solution or you have reached the time limit, open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your project. Commit all your changes and push them to GitHub.

Finally, open a browser and open a pull request from dev into main. The repository has a pull request description template - please answer all of the provided questions when making your pull request. Do not merge the pull request. Follow the steps below to confirm your submission!

## Submitting Your Solution

Open a pull request from dev into main once you are ready to submit. Do not merge the pull request. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create a pull request.
