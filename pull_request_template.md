Please answer the following questions about your work:

1- Have you manually tested the solution?

2 - Did you add a test suite? If so, how will we use it? If not, why?

3 - Did you use any 3rd party library? Why did you use it? What are the tradeoffs?

4 - Do you feel the UI/UX makes it easy to navigate the data from the API?

5 - If you had more time, what else would you add?

6 - What would you change in your current solution?

7 - On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest), how would you rate this solution?
